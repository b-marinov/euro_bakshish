# Euro Bakshish - Ride Sharing Application

A comprehensive ride-sharing platform built with **NextPy** - a pure Python full-stack framework that handles both backend and frontend in a single, unified codebase.

## Features

- **User Profiles**: Create and manage profiles as either a passenger or driver
- **Trip Planning**: Select start and end locations for trips
- **Trip Completion**: Complete trips with mutual ratings between passengers and drivers
- **Trip History**: Track complete history of all trips for both drivers and passengers
- **Rating System**: Maintain user ratings based on reviews from completed trips

## Project Structure

```
euro_bakshish/
├── euro_bakshish_app.py   # Main NextPy application (frontend + backend)
├── requirements-nextpy.txt # Python dependencies
└── docs/                   # Project documentation
```

**Note:** This application uses NextPy framework, which provides a unified Python codebase for both frontend and backend - no JavaScript needed!

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: NextPy - Pure Python full-stack framework
- **Backend**: FastAPI (built into NextPy)
- **Frontend**: React components via NextPy (no JavaScript needed!)
- **Database**: SQLModel with SQLite/PostgreSQL support
- **State Management**: Built-in NextPy state management
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended) 🚀

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-nextpy.txt

# Run the application
python euro_bakshish_app.py

# Access the application
# Web: http://localhost:3000
# API: http://localhost:8000/api/
```

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)

**Note**: Write everything in Python - NextPy handles the JavaScript/React generation automatically!

### Security

⚠️ **Security**: The NextPy application uses proper password hashing with bcrypt. See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) before deploying to production.

Key security features:
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ⚠️ Requires HTTPS in production
- ⚠️ Configure database properly for production
- ⚠️ Keep dependencies updated

## Quick Commands

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode with hot reload
python euro_bakshish_app.py

# Production mode
nextpy run --env prod
```

### Database Management

```bash
# Initialize database
python -c "from euro_bakshish_app import init_db; init_db()"

# The database is automatically created when you run the app for the first time
```

## API Documentation

The NextPy application provides a unified API that's automatically generated and documented.

### Interactive API Documentation
When the application is running, access:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs/`
- **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc/`

### Key Endpoints

All API endpoints are automatically generated by NextPy based on the application state and models:

- **Authentication**: Login/Register/Logout
- **Users**: Profile management
- **Trips**: Create, view, accept, and manage trips
- **Reviews**: Rate and review completed trips

### Quick API Test
```bash
# The NextPy framework handles all API routing automatically
# Test by using the web interface or the auto-generated API docs
```
